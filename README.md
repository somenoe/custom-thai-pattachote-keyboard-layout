# PSD's Custom Thai Pattachote Keyboard Layout

I took this rarely used layout and gave it a makeover to suit modern needs. Here’s what I did:

1. Aligned the number row with the QWERTY layout and swapped out a few of those obscure symbols for more practical non-alphabet characters.
1. Moved ุ  ู off the number row

## Building the Layout

You’ll need the [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134). As for detailed instructions, feel free to Google that part.
